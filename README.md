## Features

- GitHub-style activity graph - Visual overview of your conversation activity

- Full-text search - Search through all your conversations with minsearch
- Conversation details - View complete message history for any conversation
- Export to Markdown - Download conversations as `.md` files
- Dark theme - GitHub-inspired dark UI
- Responsive mobile UI - On phones (<768px) the app becomes a two-tab experience:
  - Tag: infinite-scrolling feed of untagged conversations (oldest first) with an expanded preview card and one-tap user tagging
  - Browse: month-by-month mini calendars, day drill-down, and search, with full-screen conversation view
- Tablet & desktop keyboard shortcuts - `j`/`k` to move through conversations, `1`-`9` to tag with the Nth user, `x` to untag, `u` to undo, `/` to focus search, `?` for the shortcut overlay

## Development

### Backend (FastAPI + Python)
```bash
cd backend
uv sync                    # Install dependencies
make dev                   # Run with auto-reload on port 8080
```

### Frontend (Vite + vanilla JS)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install                # Install dependencies
npm run build              # Build for production
npm run dev                # Dev server with hot reload
```
